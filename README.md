my project will be a unmodderated forum where anyone can post a sentance of 5 words to a real time feed. (this is a good idea)

it consumes api from database on server, as well as data from a time api for good real time time.

My front end will be react tm along with axios for api calls.
https://ant.design for ui

My backend will be django tm using restframework technolagy

There shalt be no bugs.

Unfortunatly I somehow broke the user creation endpoint on the backend while implementing the user-quote database relationship.

An earlier version of my project will showcase this feature working.

Everying else is functional, including the quote submission endpoint
